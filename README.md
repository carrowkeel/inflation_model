# Model of the "inflation hypothesis" of the handicap principle

This repository contains the simulation code for generating data from the paper published in Behavioural Ecology [doi link].

The simulation code is written in ECMAScript which can be run using Node.js or in a browser window. The benefit of the latter solution is it allows visualisation in real-time.

## Requirements

To run the simulation with Node.js, you will need to install it on your computer (see https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Downloading code

Create a directory to store the code and either download the zip file from this repository via the Github interface, or clone the repository into the directory.

## Running simulation

The file contains the simulation step function and an example of how the step function can be used to generate data. Edit the options object to manipulate the simulation parameters. At the moment running the simulation file (inflation_model.js) will print the result of a single simulation.

```
node inflation_model.js
```
